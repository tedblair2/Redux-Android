# Redux Android
This project shows how to use redux state management with apollo client when making queries to a graphql API. It comprises the various parts of redux
architecture including State, Reducer, Action, Store and Middleware to handle side effects.
I however have changed it a little bit and have a store per viewmodel in order to leverage the functionality that comes with the viewModel in android
architecture and developement.
