This project shows how to use redux state management with apollo client when making queries to a graphql API. It comprises the various parts of redux
architecture including State, Reducer, Action, Store and Middleware to handle side effects.

A central Store is used and injected with hilt as a singleton so that a single instance 
exists throughout an application life.
